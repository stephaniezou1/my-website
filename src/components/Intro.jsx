                <p> Hi! My name is Stephanie Zou. I'm a full-stack web developer and a recent graduate of Flatiron School where I completed an intensive software engineering bootcamp. 
                <br/><br/>
                Over the course of 15 weeks at Flatiron, I built five full-stack web applications using Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, React.js, Redux.js, HTML and various CSS libraries. I've also linked the GitHub repo for this website in the footer (built with React.js!)
                <br/><br/>
                Before Flatiron, I graduated early in December 2019 with the class of 2020 from NYU's Stern School of Business with a B.S. degree in Business and Political Economy (BPE).
                <br/><br/>
                When I'm not working, you'll most likely find me outside in the sun either on a run or on a bike, reading the news (longform articles + twitter), listening to podcasts (@PodSaveThePeople + @A16z), reading short stories and books (often rec'd by my friends @naomi and @mina), watching a movie, cooking with friends, or phonebanking for candidates!
                <br/><br/>
                Please feel free to connect with me via social media or shoot me an email - links are in the footer.
