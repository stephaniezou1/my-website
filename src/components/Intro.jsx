                <p> Hi! My name is Stephanie Zou.
                I'm a full-stack web developer and graduate of Flatiron School where I completed a software engineering bootcamp. 
                <br/><br/>
                I've built apps using Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, React.js, Redux.js, HTML and various CSS libraries.
                <br/><br/>
                Before Flatiron, I graduated early in December 2019 with the class of 2020 from NYU's Stern School of Business with a B.S. degree in Business and Political Economy (BPE).
                <br/><br/>
                I'm currently working at the Walt Disney Company on the strategy team for Disney's Media and Entertainment Distribution. My team focuses on building our streaming services and all direct-to-consumer initiatives!
                <br/><br/>
                My interests include: civic hacking, media disruption, social policy, angel investing, and equitable urban development.
