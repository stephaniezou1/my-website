                <p> Hello, my name is Stephanie Zou. I am a full-stack web developer and a recent Flatiron School grad where I completed an intensive software engineering bootcamp. Over the course of 15 weeks, we built web apps using Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, React.js, Redux.js, HTML and various CSS libraries. Before Flatiron, I had just graduated with the class of 2020 from NYU's Stern School of Business with a B.S. degree in Business and Political Economy (BPE).</p>
