                <p> Hi! 👋🏻 My name is Stephanie Zou. I'm a full-stack web developer and a recent graduate of Flatiron School where I completed an intensive software engineering bootcamp. 
                <br/><br/>
                Over the course of 15 weeks at Flatiron, I built web apps using Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, React.js, Redux.js, HTML and various CSS libraries. 
                <br/><br/>
                Before Flatiron, I graduated early in December 2019 with the class of 2020 from NYU's Stern School of Business with a B.S. degree in Business and Political Economy (BPE).
